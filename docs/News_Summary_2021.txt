Global Overview – 2021

The world entered 2021 with renewed hope as multiple vaccines for the Raxon Virus became available. While economic recovery began slowly, new waves of infection in some regions delayed reopenings. The year was marked by innovation, adaptation, and digital acceleration across nearly every sector. Global trade started to rebound, but supply chain congestion and raw material shortages created inflationary pressures.

Economic and Business Developments

1. Gradual Recovery and Inflation Concerns:
Global GDP grew by 3.2% in 2021, signaling recovery from the prior year’s deep recession. However, price hikes in logistics and commodities pushed inflation to its highest level in a decade. Central banks maintained low interest rates to encourage growth.

2. E-commerce Giants Dominate Retail:
QuickBite, after its record-breaking 2020, acquired grocery chain FreshWell to expand into essential goods delivery. Meanwhile, ShopStream introduced live video-based shopping, merging social media and retail in a new “shopcast” format.

3. Sundale Motors Returns to Profit:
After last year’s loss, Sundale Motors rebounded with the launch of its electric SUV, the “Aurora X.” The vehicle’s strong pre-orders and eco-friendly appeal helped the company post a 9% net profit for the year.

4. Construction and Housing Boom:
Lockdowns led to increased home renovation spending. The construction industry saw a 25% rise in residential projects, while housing prices in major urban areas surged by 18%.

5. Global Shipping Crisis:
A shortage of shipping containers caused delays and cost spikes in global trade. The incident at the Port of Malora, where a cargo vessel blocked a key channel for two weeks, highlighted vulnerabilities in global logistics.

For the first time in modern history, renewable energy production surpassed coal power generation. Companies like Solyra Energy led this shift, investing heavily in solar storage grids.
